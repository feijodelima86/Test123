# Preliminary Analyses

This document contains preliminary analyses regarding the BAM_RAB data set as it stands. These preliminary analyses focus on the following elements: As,Cd,Cu,Fe,Pb,Se,Zn. These elements were selected based on interest in the "Big 5" contaminants of concern plus Fe due to our interest in particle formation. I also added Se given the current interests of our extended research group, as well as some interesting parallels between the behavior of Se and Zn.
